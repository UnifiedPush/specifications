## Resources

* All extras typed String MUST be UTF-8 encoded.
* All required extras MUST be non-null.
* Any request containing an extra that do not follow the specification MUST be ignored.
* End user application: This is the application that will receive notifications with UnifiedPush; All the logic required for the end user application can be done with a library.
* Connection Token: This is a randomly generated token to identify the registration from the connector and the distributor. This token is generated by the connector, and send for the first time during the registration intent (org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.REGISTER). This token must contain sufficient entropy so it cannot be guessed. To generate this token, UUIDv4 ([RFC9562]) is suggested. It is unique on distributor and connector side. Every requests to the connector contains this token. If the connector doesn't know this token, the request is ignored. This is a string of maximum 100 bytes.
* VAPID public key: This is a public key on the P-256 curve encoded in the uncompressed form [SEC 1] (section 2.3.3, replicated from X9.62), and base64url encoded [RFC7515]. This public key is generated by the end user application, and send during the registration intent ([org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.REGISTER]). It is used by the application server to identify itself to the push server, following the [RFC8292]. Some distributors MAY require a valid VAPID key, and response with a registration fail if not present ([org.unifiedpush.android.connector.REGISTRATION_FAILED]). This is a 87 bytes long string.
* Message Id: This is an id to identify a message from the distributor to the connector. If present, the connector must acknowledge the message to the distributor (with [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.MESSAGE_ACK]). This is a string of maximum 100 bytes. To prevent an application to acknowledge another application's message, the distributor SHOULD either:
  * Use unique token which contain sufficient entropy so it cannot be guessed; UUIDv4 ([RFC9562]) is suggested.
  * Save this id linked to the connection token, so a same id could be send to 2 different applications but one cannot acknowledge for the other.
* Push message: This is an array of bytes sent by the application server to the push server. The distributor sends this message to the end user application. It MUST be the raw POST data received by the push server (or the rewrite proxy if present). The message MUST be an encrypted content that follows [RFC8291]. Its size is between 1 and 4096 bytes (inclusive).
* Endpoint: This is the URL of the push resource as defined by [RFC8030]. This url point to the push server and is distributed to the end user application by the distributor. This MUST be at most 1000 bytes.
* Pending endpoint: This is an endpoint that hasn't been acknowledged by the end user application.

## Push Distributor

The push distributor MUST expose the [Registration Broadcast Receiver], allowing end user applications to register for push related messages.

### Distributor manifest

The push distributor MUST expose a broadcast receiver with the following actions:
* [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.REGISTER]
* [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.UNREGISTER]

This broadcast receiver is the Registration Broadcast Receiver.

### Optional features

Some additionnal features may be added in the future. The distributor who implements it MUST expose the action linked to the feature.

## End User Application

The end user application MUST expose the [Messaging Broadcast Receiver], allowing the distributor to send push related messages.

### End User Application Manifest

The library itself does not declare any activity, service or receiver in the manifest. The end user application integrating the library MUST expose a broadcast receiver with the following actions:
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.NEW_ENDPOINT]
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.UNREGISTERED]
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.MESSAGE]
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.REGISTRATION_FAILED]

This broadcast receiver is the Messaging Broadcast Receiver.

## Registration Broadcast Receiver

The exposed broadcast receiver of the push distributor MUST handle 2 different actions:
* [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.REGISTER]
* [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.UNREGISTER]

There is a third action the distributor SHOULD handle:
* [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.MESSAGE_ACK]

### org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.REGISTER

The connector sends this action to register to push messages. The intent MUST contain 2 extras:
* application (String): the end user application package name. The distributor MUST be able to handle many registrations with a single application.
* token (String): This is the connection token as defined in the [Resources]. This is where a new token is used for the first time.

It MAY be sent with one or more of the following 3 extras:
* features (ArrayList\<String\>): indicate the connector is requesting a set of optional features to be enabled. It MUST be the qualified name of the action declared to advertise this feature. The connector MUST check that the action is declared before requesting an optional feature.
* message (String): a short description of the purpose of the registration that the distributor MAY show to the user.
* vapid (String, 87 bytes):  a VAPID public key as defined in the [Resources]. Some distributors MAY require a valid VAPID key, and response with [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.REGISTRATION_FAILED] if it is not present.

The distributor MUST send a broadcast intent to one of the following actions when it handles this action:
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.NEW_ENDPOINT]
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.REGISTRATION_FAILED]

The distributor SHOULD NOT create a new endpoint if a valid registration exist for the token and nothing has been updated.

The distributor SHOULD check the application contained in the extra is installed on the device and exposes UnifiedPush actions in its manifest. If the application is not installed or do not expose the actions, a warning about unusual activity may be shown to the user, and the registration MUST be ignored.

The distributor MAY limit the number of allowed registrations per application. This limit SHOULD be over 1000. If the limit is reached, the distributor should inform the user and the next registration fail.

The distributor MAY limit the number of pending endpoint, as defined in the [Resources]. This is defined under [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.NEW_ENDPOINT] section.

### org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.UNREGISTER

The connector sends this action to unregister from push messages. The intent MUST contain 1 extra:
* token (String): This is the connection token as defined in the [Resources] supplied by the end user application during registration. If this token is not known by the distributor, the distributor will ignore this request.

After sending this action, the end user application MUST remove the connection token from the valid tokens even if the unregistration is not acknowledged by the distributor with [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.UNREGISTERED]. The end user application MAY cache this connection token to inform the user if the unregistration is not acknowledge after some time.

The distributor MUST send [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.UNREGISTER] when the unregistration is being processed right after the unregistration request. If the distributor can't process the unregistration right after the unregistration request, for instance if the distributor can't reach its push server, the distributor MUST send [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.UNREGISTER] when the required information to delete the endpoint have been saved, and process the unregistration when possible.

### org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.MESSAGE_ACK

Whenever the connector receives a message with the extra id it MUST reply with this action to the distributor to acknowledge the message's reception.

The intent MUST contain 2 extras:
* token (String): This is the connection token as defined in the [Resources] supplied by the end user application during registration. If this token is not known by the distributor, the distributor will ignore this request.
* id (String, max 100 bytes): This is the message id as defined in the [Resources].

A distributor MAY retry to send a message that has not been acknowledged.

## Messaging Broadcast Receiver

The exposed broadcast receiver of the end user application MUST handle 2 differents actions:
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.NEW_ENDPOINT]
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.MESSAGE]

There are 2 additional actions the connector SHOULD handle:
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.UNREGISTERED]
* [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.REGISTRATION_FAILED]

### org.unifiedpush.android.connector.NEW_ENDPOINT

The distributor MUST send this action to the registered application in the following cases:
* confirm the registration of an end user application
* a registered application sends an action with the intent [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.REGISTER] and a token for an existing registration. The distributor MUST also update the features associated with the registration.
* the endpoint for the application changed

The intent MUST contain the following 2 extras:
* token (String): This is the connection token as defined in the [Resources] supplied by the end user application during registration. If this token is not known by the connector, the connector will ignore this request.
* endpoint (String): the endpoint URL as defined in the [Resources].

It MAY be sent with the following extra:
* id (String, max 100 bytes): This is the message id as defined in the [Resources]. If present, the connector MUST response with [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.MESSAGE_ACK]. An endpoint that hasn't been acknowledge (with [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.MESSAGE_ACK]) is considered as a pending endpoint, as defined in the [Resources].

#### Pending endpoints

A distributor MAY remove pending endpoints, as defined in the [Resources], that haven't receive any [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.MESSAGE_ACK] within 30 seconds after the new endpoint intent. If the distributor removes the endpoint, it MUST send [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.UNREGISTERED] to the end user application.

A distributor MAY limit the number of pending endpoints per applications. This limit SHOULD be over 30 per application. If the distributor limits the number of pending endpoint and receive a registration request ([org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.REGISTER]) while this limit is reached, it MUST send [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.REGISTRATION_FAILED] with the reason "TOO_MANY_PENDING_REQUESTS".

### org.unifiedpush.android.connector.REGISTRATION_FAILED

The distributor MUST send this action to the registered application if:
* the token is already registered for another application
* the registration can not be processed (for instance when the distributor is not connected to its server)
* a requested feature is not supported by the distributor

The action MUST contain the following extra:
* token (String): This is the connection token as defined in the [Resources] supplied by the end user application during registration. If this token is not known by the connector, the connector will ignore this request.

The intent MAY contain 1 additional extra:
* reason (String): the type of error causing the registration fail.

The reason MUST be either:
* "INTERNAL_ERROR": This is a generic error type, the connector can try again later
* "NETWORK": The registration failed because of missing network connection, try again when network is back.
* "ACTION_REQUIRED": The distributor requires a user action to work. For instance, the distributor may be log out of the push server and requires the user to log in. If the distributor has a limit of number of registrations and this limit has been reached, the distributor sends this reason.
* "TOO_MANY_PENDING_REQUESTS": The distributor implements a limit of concurrent pending endpoints, as defined in the [Resources], and this limit has been reached. The end user application SHOULD wait 30 seconds before trying again or wait to acknowledge at least one received endpoint before continuing.
* "VAPID_REQUIRED": If the distributor requires a VAPID key and the end user application doesn't send one, the distributor respond with this reason.
* "UNSUPPORTED_FEATURES": If the end user application request a feature the distributor doesn't support, the distributor respond with this reason. It MUST include another extras:
  * features (ArrayList\<String\>), with the list of unsupported requested features.

The connector MUST change the registration token received with this action for the next registration.

If a connector receives this action after it already received a NEW_ENDPOINT action for the same token then it MUST ignore this action.

### org.unifiedpush.android.connector.MESSAGE

The distributor MUST send this action to the registered application to forward a push message received on the push server to the end user application.

The distributor MUST send the following 2 extras:
* token (String): This is the connection token as defined in the [Resources] supplied by the end user application during registration. If this token is not known by the connector, the connector will ignore this request.
* bytesMessage (ByteArray): This is the push message as defined in the [Resources].

It MAY be sent with the following extra:
* id (String, max 100 bytes): This is the message id as defined in the [Resources]. If present, the connector MUST response with [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.MESSAGE_ACK].

The distributor SHOULD follow the push message urgency as defined in [RFC8030], section 5.3. If the push server does not send an urgency header, the urgency is considered as normal. Else, only messages more urgent than the minimum urgency SHOULD be send to the end user application. The minimum urgency depending on the device state is as follow, in order of increasing urgency:

| Urgency  | Device State                | Example Application                         |
|----------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| very-low | On power and Wi-Fi          | Advertisements                              |
| low      | On either power or Wi-Fi    | Topic updates                               |
| normal   | On neither power nor Wi-Fi  | Chat or Calendar Message                    |
| high     | Low battery                 | Incoming phone call or time-sensitive alert |



### org.unifiedpush.android.connector.UNREGISTERED

The distributor MUST send this action to the registered application to inform it about unregistration.

The intent MUST have the following extra:
* token (String): This is the connection token as defined in the [Resources] supplied by the end user application during registration. If this token is not known by the connector, the connector will ignore this request.

This is send when:
* A connection is deleted from the distributor or the push server
* The distributor log out of the push server
* No message has been acknowledge with [org.unifiedpush.android.distributor.MESSAGE_ACK] within the last 30 days. The distributor MUST send a ping with [org.unifiedpush.android.connector.NEW_ENDPOINT] before, to avoid unregistering a valid connection.
